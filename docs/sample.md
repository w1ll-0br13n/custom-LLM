# Sample Documentation

This is a sample documentation file to demonstrate the expected format for training the custom AI model. Replace this file with your actual project documentation.

## Format Guidelines

- Use clear headings and subheadings
- Include detailed explanations
- Document APIs, functions, and features
- Provide examples where appropriate

## Example Section

### Feature Description
This section describes a key feature of the project. The description should be detailed enough for the AI to understand and answer questions about it.

### Usage Example
```python
# Example code showing how to use the feature
feature = ProjectFeature()
result = feature.process()
```

### Configuration
Describe any configuration options and their effects:
- Option 1: Description of what this option does
- Option 2: Another configuration option explained

## Best Practices

1. Keep documentation up to date
2. Use consistent formatting
3. Include error handling information
4. Document all public interfaces

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions should be documented here:

- Issue 1: Description of the problem and its solution
- Issue 2: Another common problem and how to resolve it
